# ReduceNoiseLightScattering

**This project is from December 2016, and I have grown significantly as a programmer since then. If you would like to see some of my more recent, cleaner, work, I would recommend looking at [Marsican](github.com/aschams/Marsican). I have retroactively tried to clean the repo up, so some things may be missing. Please raise an issue if code is missing and I will see what I can do to fix it.**

The goal of this project was to reduce the amount of noise in light-scattering readings gathered using stopped-flow. Noise reduction is attempted through different levels of Discrete Haar Transforms paired with various filters.

## Structure of Repo

### Code

The various functions used, including Discrete Haar Transform and Inverse Haar Transform.

### Data

Example excel files containing the raw scattering data collected via stopped flow

### img

Images used in the report. They are .tif files and are therefore not available to preview on GitHub (or in GitHub's Markdown.)

Final report is [here](MATH416_Final_Project.pdf), which includes results and discussion.
